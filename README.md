## Why DeMeta?

Every file you create contains hidden information called **metadata** - dates, locations, device details, author names, and more. When you share files online, this data can reveal more about you than you intend.

**DeMeta gives you control over your digital footprint.**

### 🔥 Key Features

- **🛡️ Privacy-First**: Most processing happens locally in your browser
- **📁 Comprehensive**: Supports images, documents, audio, and video files
- **🗑️ Zero Storage**: Files are never stored on our servers
- **🔓 Open Source**: Transparent, auditable code
- **💚 Free Forever**: No hidden costs or premium tiers
